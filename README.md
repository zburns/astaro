# Astaro/Sophos UTM 9 Offline Log Backup Program

This will backup an Astaro/Sophos UTM 9 /var/log directory and its contents to a local file system.  This is good for performing external examination of the logs (both historical and live) and also just having them around for backup purposes and forensics.

Note, this DOES NOT make any modifications to the Astaro/Sophos UTM 9 at all.  It simply performs an SCP file download of any new or changes files from the UTM.
